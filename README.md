Costco Receipt Downloader
A JavaScript snippet that fetches your Costco order history and converts it into a detailed CSV format suitable for spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets).

Features
Detailed Data: Exports 28 columns including Item Name, Unit Price, Quantity, Tax Flags, and Discounts.

Smart Math: Automatically calculates individual unit prices (e.g., price per steak) and handles item quantities.

Adjustments: properly handles "Instant Savings," CRV taxes, and other surcharges by attaching them to the correct items rather than listing them as separate rows.

No Extension Required: Runs directly in your browser console.

How to Use
Login: Go to www.costco.com and log in to your account.

Navigate: Go to the Order Status page.

Note: You must be on this specific page for the script to access the correct authorization tokens.

Open Console:

Windows: Press F12 or right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect, then click the Console tab.

Mac: Press Command + Option + J (Chrome) or Command + Option + C (Safari).

Run: Copy the entire script, paste it into the console, and press Enter.

Download: The script will fetch your history and automatically trigger a .csv download.

Configuration
Changing the Date Range
By default, the script pulls receipts starting from January 1, 2023. To change this:

Scroll to the bottom of the script to the downloadFullCsv function.

Find the line: var startDateStr = '01/01/2023';

Update the date using the MM/DD/YYYY format.

Troubleshooting
Pop-up Blockers: If the download does not start immediately, check your address bar for a "Pop-up blocked" icon and allow it.

400 Bad Request: If you see network errors, ensure you are using the version of the script that requests the standard itemArray rather than extended fields (like specific department IDs) which are restricted by the Costco API.
